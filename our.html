        <h2>Cyclops Legion is an Esports Organization based in Bangladesh.
         It was actually an ambitious project of a trio but without any plan.
          At a time we all got separated and disbanded CL because of some personal reason.
           But after 2 month we reformed Cyclops again but this time with a better plan and well execution.
            Wanting to do something greater than before. We got teams of Valorant, CSGO, R6S, Fortnite.
             Currently our main goal is to represent our country in the international competitive scene.
